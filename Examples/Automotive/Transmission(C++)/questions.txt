Questions:

1) How do the states in ClutchBase relate to the states in our previous clutch

Slipping
Locked
Sticking


was:

Stick
Slip
Reverse


2) How are the following transitions triggered:

a) Slipping to sticking

b) sticking to slipping

c) sticking to locked

d) locked to slipping


3) How is Engine::r_interpolation(double *res) supposed to work

//*res = torque -  torqueMap.interpolate_2D(throttle,RPM,torque); 

// TODO: fix the following line per the intent.  It won't compile this way.  
//*res = p->T - torqueMap.interpolate_2D(throttle,RPM,&(p->T)); 
	

->my solution:
  double t = 0.0;
  // TODO: confirm that this is correct
  torqueMap.interpolate_2D(throttle,RPM,&t); 
  *res = p->T - t; 
 

4) Clutch base class

-->> notes on how I had to implement it:

Put all the Init() functions in the derived Esos.
Couldn't have clutch base derive from model base because it caused ambiguous inheritance.
The implication is that a complete model cannot used as a base class for a derived model.  We will have to get around this.
