# sio_Digital_Twin_archive

The audience of this source code repository are developers of the new synaptics.io digital twin engine. Only source code will be migrated in order to support synaptics.io executable model engines.

## Limitations (to be addressed during migration to synaptics.io)
The archive source code is platform specific (Windows) and is targeting real-time UML and requirements tools. Real-Time OS are supported via simulation only (of real-time OS kernel, scheduler and synchronization primitives, ...).
