<h2><a name="system"></a>System Requirements</h2>

<p>
This class can be used on any operating system having an ANSI / ISO compatible C++ compiler. The C++ compiler must have good support for <b><i>template</i></b>, <b><i>namespace</i></b>, and <b><i>valarray</i></b> class. This class has been tested with the following compilers only.
</p>

<p>
<ul>
  <li>MS Visual C++ 5.0, 6.0 &amp; 7.0</li>
  <li>Borland C++ 5.5</li>
  <li>C++ Builder 4.0 &amp; 5.0</li>
  <li>Metrowerks CodeWarrior 6.0 or higher</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
However, this class can be used with any other modern C++ compilers on any platform. If you are using, or want to use a different compiler not listed above, please contact us at <a href="mailto:matrix@techsoftpl.com"> matrix@techsoftpl.com</a>.
</p>


<h3><a name="install"></a>Installation</h3>

<p>
To install the Matrix TCL Pro, please copy &quot;<b>cmatrix</b>&quot;, &quot;<b>matrix.h</b>&quot;, and &quot;<b>matrix.cc</b>&quot; files into the <b><i>INCLUDE</i></b> directory of your compiler. Alternatively, you can add the full path name to these files into the <b><i>INCLUDE</i></b> path list of your compiler. To uninstall the library, remove these files from your computer.
</p>


<h3>Testing</h3>

<p>
To test the Matrix TCL Pro class, we have included a test program named <b>testmat.cpp</b> with this package. You may compile and run this program on your machine to test this class. This program should be compiled by your compiler error free. However, since most of the tests are performed on randomly generated matrices, some test may fail occasionally due to ill-conditioned / singular matrix, and/or for greater round-off error produced in some matrix operations. If you encounter any reproducible compile-time, or repeated run-time error, please send the complete error information along with the name and version number of your compiler to &lt;<a href="mailto:matrix@techsoftpl.com">matrix@techsoftpl.com</a>&gt;.
