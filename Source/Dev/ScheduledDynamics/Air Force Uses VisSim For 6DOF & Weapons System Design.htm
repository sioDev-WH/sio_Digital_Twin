      width=170 align=right>Using VisSim, the Air Force Research Laboratory 
      (AFRL) at Eglin Air Force Base has developed a high-fidelity 
      6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) modeling system that simulates the flight 
      dynamics and performance of a state-of-the-art weapons system. The 
      modeling system was built under the Munition Simulation Tools and 
      Resources (MSTARS) project at AFRL by a joint government/ contractor team 
      led by Larry Lewis, Munition Flyout Team Leader. <BR><BR>Designed for the 
      rapid prototyping of new guided bomb and missile concepts, as well as the 
      evaluation of new technology performance, MSTARS includes a library of 
      VisSim-based munitions subsystems representing the accelerometer, rate 
      gyro, autopilot, seeker, inertial navigation system, control surfaces, and 
      air vehicle, with complete 6-DOF flight dynamics. Simplified models of a 
      launch aircraft and threat target are also incorporated into the component 
      library. Nearly 70 VisSim models and DLLs are currently in the library, 
      and many more are being added monthly. Several guided bomb and missile 
      6-DOF simulations have been built using these components. <BR><BR>The 
      current MSTARS system is the culmination of work which began about a year 
      ago when Lewis first created a prototype 6-DOF simulation using VisSim. 
      "We had been using another modeling system which simply was not meeting 
      our objectives. After doing a detailed comparison of several outstanding 
      products, my team decided to go with VisSim for MSTARS. It was a scary 
      prospect to re-do our previous work, but we've accomplished more in one 
      year than we had in the previous three years." <BR><BR>According to Lewis, 
      numerous VisSim features were essential in building the 6-DOF system. 
      "Embed blocks allowed us to build a truly reusable library of components," 
      said Lewis. "And path aliases tied to the embed blocks let us specify a 
      complete simulation configuration, eliminating the use of lengthy file 
      specifications." <BR><BR>Lewis emphasized that this modular approach to 
      system design not only saved valuable time during the design and debugging 
      phases, but also allowed engineers to quickly test the effectiveness of 
      new subsystem component designs. "Whenever we came up with a new design, 
      we just changed a single name to swap the new component into the 
      simulation." <BR><BR><IMG height=188 hspace=12

      width=125 align=right vspace=12 border=0>Reuse of legacy code written in 
      Fortran and Ada was facilitated by VisSim's DLL capability, as was the 
      creation of new models and special utilities. "This ability to reuse 
      existing code and create special-purpose code via DLLs shaved months off 
      our development schedule," said Lewis. New DLLs are constantly being 
      added, written in C++, FORTRAN, and Ada 95. <BR><BR>In large model design, 
      the dynamics of the system generally demands multirate simulation. In the 
      6-DOF system, discrete transfer functions, unit delays, and automatic DLLs 
      were used to achieve different update rates. "This allowed us to 
      dramatically reduce computation time and speed up the simulation," 
      explained Lewis. <BR><BR>Within the Eglin AFB community, VisSim and the 
      MSTARS modeling system have received favorable reviews. Lewis plans to 
      present and demonstrate the VisSim-based MSTARS system at the Joint 
      Avionics, Weapons, and Systems Symposium in Las Vegas in June of this 
      year. </P>
